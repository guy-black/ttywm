-- implement alt+tab window switcher
  - pop up modal shows all windows
  - able to change ws on the currently seleected window with alt+1-8
  - able to move it to top of the stack and move cursor to be over the window
    - will need to work out how to handle bringing it into visible workspace
    -- ie if the window is on 01001000 but my ws is 00000111:
      should I change my workspace to 01000111, or to 00001111 or even 01001111 or
      should I change the windwo to 01001001 or 01001010 or 01001100 or 0100111 or what???
-- make all the windows work as terminals
  - golang.org/x/term ???
  - okay so the NewTerminal function takes a ReaderWriter and a string for prompt
    - but other functions hint at a file description
    - and everything is a file, including terminals
    - and there is already a reader writer for files
    - so I think I'm supposed to get a fd for a terminal
    - set it into raw mode, and the pass it's readerwriter to newTerminal
-- implement small qol fun
  - load and save list of windows
  - "wallpaper" selector and creator
    - shows all "wallpapers" loaded by default
    - editor to create a new wallpaper
    - generate code to add to the config to have the wallpaper available on load
  - color picker for everything
  - list all open windows and their ws flags
    - edit ws flags from here
  - allow for border on bgs
  - add more bgs
