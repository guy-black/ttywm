-- implement alt+c to bring up textInput to change name of window if one is selected
-- implement workspace bitmapped
  - use bit map idea from river
  - if shown ws is 00000000 then just don't show any windows
  - if a window is set to 00000000 the completely hide it until it is changed
  - if cursor is over a window, then alt+1-8 toggle a bit in that window's onWS field
    ie alt+1 sets onWS = onWS ^ 0b10000000
    if the first bit was already 1 then xor will make it 0, if it's 0 then xor will make it one
  - if cursor is not over a window, then alt+1-8 will toggle a bit in the model's visWs
  - in view drawWin will only be applied if window.onWS & m.visWS != 0
  - getCurWinInd should also ignore windows if window.onWS & m.visWS == 0
-- implement alt+tab window switcher
  - pop up modal shows all windows
  - able to change ws on the currently seleected window with alt+1-8
  - able to move it to top of the stack and move cursor to be over the window
    - will need to work out how to handle bringing it into visible workspace
    -- ie if the window is on 01001000 but my ws is 00000111:
      should I change my workspace to 01000111, or to 00001111 or even 01001111 or
      should I change the windwo to 01001001 or 01001010 or 01001100 or 0100111 or what???
-- make all the windows work as terminals
  - golang.org/x/term ???
  - okay so the NewTerminal function takes a ReaderWriter and a string for prompt
    - but other functions hint at a file description
    - and everything is a file, including terminals
    - and there is already a reader writer for files
    - so I think I'm supposed to get a fd for a terminal
    - set it into raw mode, and the pass it's readerwriter to newTerminal
-- implement small qol fun
  - "wallpaper" selector and creator
    - shows all "wallpapers" loaded by default
    - editor to create a new wallpaper
    - generate code to add to the config to have the wallpaper available on load
  - color picker for everything
  - list all open windows and their ws flags
    - edit ws flags from here
  - allow for border on bgs
  - add more bgs
